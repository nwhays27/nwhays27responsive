          <p>
            I was born in Dallas on May 10th of 1995. I was raised in Coppell,Texas until the age of 13 when I moved
            to Roanoke,Texas.
            I have always had a profound interest in computers and technology ever since I can remember. I was always
            playing baseball and working out, but the other side of me was a complete geek.
            If I had any down time, there was no doubt I'd be on my computer either gaming, or just researching and
            learning about things I had no knowledge of.
            <br>
            <br>
            Writing code and programming is one thing I've always had an interest in and wanted to learn more about.
            After working 6 days a week since I was 18 years old, I've decided to make an attempt to change my life at
            the age of 24. I decided to enroll in SMU's programming/web development bootcamp. So far, I believe it is
            the best decision I have made in my life!
            <br>
            <br>
            My goals for the future are to get involved with the tech industry and make a difference. My dream is to
            ultimately develop something that will help people and be used by millions.
